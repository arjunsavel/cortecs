cortecs
==================================
*cortecs* is a Python package for compressing opacity files used in radiative transfer. We offer a few different
types of compression methods with a range of flexibility, from polynomial to neural networks. We also provide utility
functions for working with opacity files, such as chunking and interpolating them onto different grids.

*scope* is currently under development `on GitHub <https://github.com/arjunsavel/cortecs>`_ and is ready for beta users.
If there are any issues with the code, please feel free to `report them <https://github.com/arjunsavel/cortecs/issues>`_
on the GitHub page.
