"""
A few functions that can be used to chunk opacity files. Assumes that
opacity files are in the RT code format, that each opacity file to
be chunked is in its on folder, and that we are currently in that folder.


Example instructions / workflow:

>>> file = 'opacTiO.dat'
>>> chunk_wavelengths(file, wav_per_chunk=2598)
>>> filename = 'opacTiO'
>>> add_overlap(filename)

And that should work!

There's some replicated (and likely unnecessary) code, but it hopefully shouldn't
be too confusing. Furthermore, these functions have not been subjected to robust
unit testing, so they might not work right out of the box. Please let me know if
that's the case, and I'd be happy to debug :)

so far, only works for exo-transmit chunks. TODO: generalize for others.
